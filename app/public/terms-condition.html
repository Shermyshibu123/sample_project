			Apple and third party services and web sites (collectively and individually, "Services"). Such Service may
			not be available in all languages or in all countries. Use of these Services requires Internet access and
			use of certain Services may require an Apple ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be
			subject to additional fees. By using the Binera Software in connection with an iTunes Store account, Apple
			ID or other Apple Service, you agree to the applicable terms of service for that Service, such as the latest
			Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions which you may access and review at
			<a
				href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.">https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/.</a>

			indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit language.
			Nevertheless, you agree to use the Services at your sole risk and that Binera shall have no liability to you
			for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable. </li>

		<li>Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or
			materials from third parties ("Third Party Materials") or provide links to certain third party web sites. By
			using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Binera is not responsible for examining or evaluating the
			content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or
			any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Binera, its officers, affiliates and
			subsidiaries do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility
			to you or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any
			other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites
			are provided solely as a convenience to you.</li>

		<li>In using this Binera Software, you will be asked to provide information, and you must provide accurate
			information. To the extent that you upload any content through the use of the Services, you represent that
			you own all rights in, or have authorization or are otherwise legally permitted to upload, such content and
			that such content does not violate any terms of service applicable to the Services. You agree that the
			Services contain proprietary content, information and material, including but not limited to any Digital
			Materials, that is owned by Binera, the site owner and/or their licensors, and is protected by applicable
			intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright. You agree that you will not
			use such proprietary content, information or materials other than for permitted use of the Services or in
			any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this License or that infringes any intellectual property
			rights of a third party or Binera. No portion of the Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means.
			You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the
			Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever,
			including but not limited to, using the Services to transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or
			other malware, or by trespass or burdening network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in
			any manner to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any
			other party, and that Binera is not in any way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing,
			threatening, defamatory, offensive, infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as
			a result of using any of the Services.</li>

		<li>In addition, Services and Third Party Materials that may be accessed, linked to or displayed through the
			Binera Software are not available in all languages or in all countries or regions. Binera makes no
			representation that such Services and Third Party Materials are appropriate or available for use in any
			particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access such Services and Third Party Materials, you
			do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not
			limited to applicable local laws and privacy and data collection laws. Binera and its licensors reserve the
			right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event
			will Binera be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such Services. Binera may also impose
			limits on the use of or access to certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.

			SOFTWARE, ANY RECOMMENDATIONS OR GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY THE BINERA SOFTWARE ("RECOMMENDATIONS"), AND ANY

			DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE BINERA SOFTWARE, RECOMMENDATIONS AND SERVICES,
			EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR
			CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, QUIET
			ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. </li>

		<li>BINERA DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE BINERA SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, THAT
			THE RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDED BY, THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN, OR SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY, THE
			BINERA SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR NEEDS OR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE BINERA SOFTWARE OR SERVICES
			WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT ANY SERVICES WILL CONTINUE TO BE MADE AVAILABLE, THAT THE BINERA
			SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE BINERA SOFTWARE WILL BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ANY
			THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY SERVICES. INSTALLATION OF THIS BINERA SOFTWARE MAY AFFECT

		<li>CAUTION - YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE BINERA SOFTWARE, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND SERVICES SHOULD NOT BE
			RELIED UPON AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR QUALIFIED MEDICAL ADVICE AND THE BINERA SOFTWARE, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND

			OF, OR ERRORS OR INACCURACIES IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS, CONTENT, DATA OR INFORMATION PROVIDED BY, THE BINERA
			SOFTWARE OR SERVICES COULD LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE,
			INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION
			SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS. </li>

		<li>NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY BINERA OR AN BINERA AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE
			A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE BINERA SOFTWARE OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL
			NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
			WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND
			LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. </li>


	</ul>

	<p>7. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL BINERA BE LIABLE
