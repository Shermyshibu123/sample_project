	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<h4>The Binera Privacy Policy was updated on August 31, 2020.</h4>

	<h3>Your privacy is important to Binera so we've developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use,
		disclose, transfer, and store your personal information.</h3>

	<h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
	<p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.</p>

	<p>You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with <a
			href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en/affiliated-company/">Binera or a Binera affiliated company.</a>
		Binera and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this
		Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services,
		content, and advertising. You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but,
		if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or
		respond to any queries you may have.</p>

	<p>Here are some examples of the types of personal information Binera may collect and how we may use it:</p>

	<h3>What personal information we collect</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>When you download a software update, connect to our services, contact us including by social media or
			participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing
			address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location
			information, credit card information and profile information where the contact is via social media.</li>

		<li>When you share your content with family and friends using Binera products, send gift certificates and
			products, or invite others to participate in Binera services or forums, Binera may collect the information
			you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. Binera will
			use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud
			purposes.</li>

		<li>In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances, as required by
			law.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>How we use your personal information</h3>
	<p> We may process your personal information: for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, with your consent,
		for compliance with a legal obligation to which Binera is subject, for the performance of a contract to which
		you are party, in order to protect your vital interests, or when we have assessed it is necessary for the
		purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Binera or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose
		information. </li>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Binera's latest product announcements,
			software updates, and upcoming events. If you don't want to be on our mailing list, you can opt-out anytime
			by updating your preferences. </li>

		<li>We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products,
			services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes. We may also use your
			personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services
			for the benefit of all our users, and pre-screening or scanning uploaded content for potentially illegal
			content, including child sexual exploitation material. Where we use your information for anti-fraud purposes
			it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us. We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud
			purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our
			customers and our services. For certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by
			you with publicly accessible sources.</li>

		<li>We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with
			identification of users, and to determine appropriate services.</li>

		<li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications
			about changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your
			interaction with Binera, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.</li>

		<li>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to
			improve Binera's products, services, and customer communications.</li>

		<li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to
			administer those programs.</li>

		<li>If you apply for a position at Binera or we receive your information in connection with a potential role at
			Binera, we may use your information to evaluate your candidacy and to contact you. If you are a candidate,
			you will receive more information about how Binera handles candidate personal information at the time of
			application.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Source of your personal information where they are not collected from you</h3>

	<p>We may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with
		you using Binera products or invited you to participate in Binera services or forums.</p>

	<p>If you are a potential candidate for employment with Binera, we may have received your personal information from
		third parties such as recruiters or external websites. We will use the personal information we receive to
		contact you about a potential opportunity or in evaluating your candidacy. If you did not provide us your
		personal information directly, we will inform you of the source when we first contact you regarding your
		candidacy. For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices
		or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such datasets, we do so in
		accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted. When using such datasets for
		research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.</p>

	<h3>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h3>

	<p>We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.
		We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some
		examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier,
			referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Binera product is used so that we can better understand
			customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.</li>

		<li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website and from our other products and
			services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our
			customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.
			Aggregated data is considered non personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</li>

		<li>We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries. This information may
			be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services. Except in limited instances to ensure
			quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.
		</li>

		<li>With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to
			help app developers improve their apps.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as
		personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>

	<h3>Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>

	<p>Binera's websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use
		"cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better
		understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure
		the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other
		technologies as non personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or
		similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as
		personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal
		information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
	</p>

	<p>Binera also uses cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online
		services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Binera more convenient and
		personal. </p>

	<p>If you want to disable cookies and you're using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the
		privacy pane to manage your preferences. On your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down
		to the Privacy & Security section, and tap on "Block Cookies" to manage your preferences. For other browsers,
		check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. </p>

	<p>As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This
		information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider
		(ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We
		use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on
		the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a
		whole. Binera may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.</p>

	<p>In some of our email messages, we use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the Binera website. When
		customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination
		page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and
		measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you
		should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a
		format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce
		or eliminate messages sent to customers.</p>

	<h3>Disclosure to Third Parties</h3>

	<p>At times Binera may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products
		and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help Binera market to consumers. When we do,
		we require those third parties to handle it in accordance with relevant laws. Binera does not sell personal
		information, and personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. </p>

	<h2>Service Providers</h2>

	<p>Binera shares personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending
		credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing
		customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or
		satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever
		Binera operates.</p>

	<h2>Others</h2>

	<p>It may be necessary - by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities
		within or outside your country of residence - for Binera to disclose your personal information. We may also
		disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other
		issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you,
		but only where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to
		enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. This could include providing information to
		public or governmental authorities. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may
		transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.</p>

	<h2>Protection of Personal Information</h2>

	<p>Binera takes the security of your personal information very seriously. Apple online services protect your
		personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). When your personal
		data is stored by Binera, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical
		security measures. </p>

	<p>When you use some Binera products, services, or applications or post on an Binera forum, chat room, or social
		networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read,
		collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in
		these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is
		public. Please take care when using these features.</p>

	<h2>The Existence of Automated Decision-Making, Including Profiling</h2>

	<p>Binera does not take any decisions involving the use of algorithms or profiling that significantly affect you.
	</p>

	<h2>Integrity and Retention of Personal Information</h2>

	<p>Binera makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain
		your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and
		our service specific privacy summaries. When assessing these periods we carefully examine our need to collect
		personal information at all and if we establish a relevant need we only retain it for the shortest possible
		period to realize the purpose of collection unless a longer retention period is required by law.</p>

	<h2>Your Privacy Rights</h2>

	<p>For personal information we hold, we will provide you with access (including a copy) for any purpose including to
		request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Binera is not required to retain it
		by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>

	<p>We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely
		impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. We may also decline aspects of deletion
		or access requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security
		purposes as described earlier. </p>

	<h3>California</h3>

	<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act provides California consumers with the right to obtain from Binera
		information about the personal information about you that we collect, use, and disclose.</p>

	<p>If you choose to exercise your privacy rights, you have the right to not to receive discriminatory treatment or a
		lesser degree of service from Binera.</p>

	<h3>Nevada</h3>

	<p>You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information. Binera does not sell your personal
		information.</p>

	<h2>Children & Education</h2>

	<p>We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using
		Binera products and services. Children under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant
		jurisdiction, are not permitted to use certain Binera services, unless their parent provided verifiable consent
	</p>

	<h2>Location-Based Services</h2>

	<p>To provide location-based services on Binera products, Binera and our partners and licensees, such as maps data
		providers, may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of
		your device. Where available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with
		crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices'
		approximate location. Unless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that
		does not personally identify you and is used by Binera and our partners and licensees to provide and improve
		location-based products and services. For example, your device may share its geographic location with
		application providers when you opt in to their location services.</p>

	<h2>Third Party Sites and Services</h2>

	<p>Binera websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and
		services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties - for example,
		a third party iPhone app.</p>

	<p>Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is
		governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third
		parties.</p>

	<h2>International Transfers</h2>

	<p>All the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this
		Privacy Policy. </p>
